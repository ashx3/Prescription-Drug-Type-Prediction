## __Tasks__:
### Prescription Drug Type Prediction
Given data about subjects' performances on a memory test, let's try to predict which prescription drug a given subject ingested.

We will use a variety of classification models to make our predictions.

## __Description__

An experiment on the effects of anti-anxiety medicine on memory recall when being primed with happy or sad memories. The participants were done on novel Islanders whom mimic real-life humans in response to external factors.

Drugs of interest (known-as) [Dosage 1, 2, 3]:

__A - Alprazolam__ (Xanax, Long-term) [1mg/3mg/5mg]

__T - Triazolam__ (Halcion, Short-term) [0.25mg/0.5mg/0.75mg]

__S- Sugar Tablet__ (Placebo) [1 tab/2tabs/3tabs]

*Dosages follow a 1:1 ratio to ensure validity<br>
*Happy or Sad memories were primed 10 minutes prior to testing<br>
*Participants tested every day for 1 week to mimic addiction<br>

### _Building the Case_:
Obstructive effects of Benzodiazepines (Anti-Anxiety Medicine):

- Long term adverse effects on Long Term Potentiation of synapses, metacognition and memory recall ability

### _Happy Memories_:

- Research shown positive memories to have a deeper and greater volume of striatum representation under an fMRI
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627314008484
### _Sad Memories_:

- Research shown sad memories invokes better memory recall for evolutionary purpose whereas, happy memories are more susceptible to false memories

Participants - all genders above 25+ years old to ensure a fully developed pre-frontal cortex, a region responsible for higher level cognition and memory recall.
